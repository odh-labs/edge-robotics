This file describes the order, installation, wiring and software configuration process to have the Mitsubishi MELSEC PLC running.
The 2nd part of this document describes how to connect the MELSEC PLC with the Takebishi DeviceGateway (dgw) on OpenShift.

Ordering
I ordered the 3 necessary parts at the Amazon Japan website:

1. Power Supply, Base Unit, CPU Unit:

Base Unit

CPU Unit

The actual PLC (CPU Unit) is the most expensive one. I ordered a 'like new' model which was roughly Y20,000 cheaper than a brand new one.
